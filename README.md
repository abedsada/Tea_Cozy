## Codecademy front-end career path Off-Platform Project

In this [project](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path/tracks/fecp-22-making-a-website-responsive/modules/wdcp-22-layout-with-flexbox/projects/tea-cozy), you will create a fictional tea shop website on your own computer.

We will provide a design spec and image assets to help you along the way. A design [specs](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-4/img-tea-cozy-redline.jpg?_gl=1*sxssz6*_ga*MDU4NzMzMDI1Ny4xNjU3NDc5NTEw*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY3NTI1ODY2NC43MS4xLjE2NzUyNjM5NjAuNjAuMC4w) is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.

Developer notes:

* This is a responsive website that was created using flexbox and grid, which I learned in chapter 9 (Making a Website Responsive
).
* This is an Off-Platform Project which was created using Visual Studio Code and Chrome DevTools.
