# Tea Cozy

## Codecademy front-end career path Off-Platform Project

In this project, you will create a fictional tea shop website on your own computer.

We will provide a design spec and image assets to help you along the way. A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. This project assumes that you will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.

Developer notes:

* This is a responsive website that was created using flexbox and grid, which I learned in chapter 9 (Making a Website Responsive
).
* This is an Off-Platform Project which was created using Visual Studio Code and Chrome DevTools.
